# DESIGN-AND-EVALUATION-OF-THE-PV-SIMULATOR

**(MY THESIS)**

In this project, Photovoltaic simulator was designed using MATLAB Simulink. The system was designed and the results were compared to the results of the normal MATLAB PV array. the system worked under different irradiances and temperatures with very high frequency.

System's block diagram:

After designing the system, a Maximum Power Point Tracker was designed and by applying Perturb and Observe and Incremantal Conductance algorithms the system was retested. 

Results of P&O algorithm:
